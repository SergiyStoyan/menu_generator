# Javascript dynamic menu generator

JS Menu Generator is a vanilla javascript that generates a dynamic menu for content of a hosting html file when it is open in web browser.
Only a signle script with no dependency is required.
It can work either online or locally. 
It's a simple and quick way to create a documentation file with a context menu that is equally capable to work as a web and a local resource.
Tested on Chrome and IE.
